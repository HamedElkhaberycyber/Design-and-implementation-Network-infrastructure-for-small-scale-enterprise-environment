1. Introduction
Title: "Virtual Network Simulation Using EVE-NG"
Description: Provide a brief overview of the project, including its purpose (e.g., "This project demonstrates network segmentation using VLANs, showcasing skills in network design and configuration.")
Tools: Mention all tools used (EVE-NG, Cisco devices, configurations, etc.)
2. Project Objectives
Describe the goals, such as:
Implementing VLANs to segment network traffic.
Configuring inter-VLAN routing using the router.
Ensuring communication between VLANs and servers.
3. Network Topology
Include a diagram of your network topology showing:
Switch connections.
Router placement.
Server locations.
VLAN assignments.
Mention software used to create the diagram (e.g., Visio, draw.io).
4. Network Details
VLAN Details:
VLAN IDs and their purposes (e.g., VLAN 10 - Admin, VLAN 20 - Development).
Device IP Details:
Router and server IP addresses.
Switch management IP addresses.
Hardware/Software Specifications:
Types of Cisco switches and router.
Operating System of servers.
5. Configurations
Provide step-by-step configuration details:
VLAN configuration on switches.
Inter-VLAN routing setup on the router.
Server IP assignments and testing connectivity.
Include configuration code blocks.
6. Testing and Validation
Describe how you tested network functionality (e.g., ping tests, connectivity between VLANs and servers).
Attach screenshots of successful tests.
7. Challenges and Solutions
Mention any challenges faced (e.g., misconfigurations, connection issues) and how you resolved them.
8. Conclusion
Highlight key takeaways, such as how this project demonstrates your networking knowledge.
